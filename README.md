# matrix-watch
My second attempt at designing an Arduino-based smart watch.

Functions:
1. Clock
2. Alarm (wip)
3. Timer (wip)
4. Stopwatch (wip)
5. Temperature
6. Tally counter
7. Die roller
8. Moon phase

Bluetooth connectivity is planned, with a companion app in the works.
Once that is done, you should be able to read phone notifications on
your Matrix Watch.
